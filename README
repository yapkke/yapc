@author ykk
@date October 2010

The YAPC controller is created as an extremely simple event processing
engine written in pure Python.  The structure of the engine is make as
simple as possible to allow easy extension and deployment.


Installation
============

You need Python the dependencies listed below.  That's it.

Dependencies:
* simplejson: for JSON message parsing
* netifaces: for reading local network interfaces
* dpkt: for parsing packets
* memcache: for storage of information
* pysnmp: for parsing SNMP packets

YAPC also depends on other external packages to generate some of the
libraries used.  They are listed as follows, though you dun really
have to worry about it most of the time.

* pylibopenflow: to generate pyopenflow.py library

Dedication
==========

As you might have noticed, my family name is Yap.  And the project is
named YAPC.  I would like to dedicate the controller to my son Cayden
Yap, who have less attention from Dad as I writes this piece of code.
