YAPC: Yet Another Python Controller
@author ykk
@date October 2010

The YAPC controller is created as an extremely simple controller for
OpenFlow in a high level scripting language like Python.  The
structure of the controller is make as simple as possible to allow
easy extension and deployment.

Background 
========== 

There is a few OpenFlow controllers out there now.  Currently,
NOX, Onix and Beacon are the significantly complete controllers.
However, none of them are simple to install and use.  Swig is a pain
and OSGI is not small either.  As a bid for simplicity, YAPC is
created.

Finally, as you noticed by now, my family name is Yap.  And the
project is named YAPC.  I would like to dedicate the controller to my
son Cayden Yap, who have less attention from Dad as I writes this
piece of code.

Installation
============

You need Python the dependencies listed below.  That's it.

Dependencies:
* simplejson: for JSON message parsing
* netifaces: for network interfaces
* dpkt: for parsing packets
* memcache: for storage of information

YAPC also depends on other external packages to generate some of the
libraries used.  They are listed as follows, though you dun really
have to worry about it most of the time. 

* pylibopenflow: to generate pyopenflow.py library
